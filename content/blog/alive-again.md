So I oopsied my data. At least humpty dumpty goes back together easy enough.

.....

I've been trying to use git more recently, so I have both a backup and centralized copy when I work on my projects from different computers, and a way to show off my work.

Unfortunately, I'm a bit rusty, and trusted my incomplete memory before initiating a clean on the git repo. I had my config files saved, but unfortunately my site files weren't tracked...

Anywhoo, the earlier iteration of this site *was* kinda iteratively futzed until it worked, and this'll give me a chance to clean things up a bit. Glad to be back on the net, and on Github too ~~if I don't nuke it again first~~.
