Well, no hobby project is ever truly complete, but we're no longer pre-alpha.

.....

When I started this project I didn't have much of an idea of what I wanted to make, so this site sat languishing for some time. However, recently I had an opportunity that encouraged me to get my rear in gear, and finally I have something I can be proud of.

There are still some things that need fiddling. I can make some improvements to logging, automate some functions, and obviously keep adding content, but the structure is all here. I've got all the pages and styling in place, Publ handles creating and styling blog entries automagically, version control is in place with Git, and I have solid SSL secured hosting with Nginx and Certbot.

This should be a good platform for me to use into the future. *Pats self on back*
